# Create elementary OS Installer

A simple Applescript app for creating elementary OS Installer USB drives. It uses dd as a backend. It should work on any version of OS X, although it has only been tested on OS X 10.10.5

## Credits:

Most of this comes from Sam Daitzman's [elementary thumbdrive creator](https://github.com/sdaitzman/elementary-thumbdrive-creator) with a large restructuring of the UI flow, a reduction in UI text, and the removal of the ISO conversion process.

The elementary logo in the icon is from elementary LLC.
